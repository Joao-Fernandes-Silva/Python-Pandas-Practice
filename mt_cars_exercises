Import pandas and solve these questions with the use of Pandas. 

	1.	Load the mtcars dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Show the first 5 rows. How many rows and columns are there?
	2.	List all the column names. What are the data types of each column?
	3.	Select the mpg column. What is the average mpg?
	4.	Show only the mpg, hp, and wt columns for the first 10 cars.
	5.	Use describe() to get summary statistics. Which car has the highest horsepower (hp)?
	6.	Which cars have mpg > 25? Which cars have both mpg > 20 and hp < 100?
	7.	The dataset has car model names as the index. Select the row for "Toyota Corolla" and show all its values.
	8.	Sort the cars by mpg in descending order. Which 3 cars have the best fuel efficiency?
	9.	Rank all cars by weight (wt) from lightest to heaviest.
	10.	What is the average mpg for cars grouped by number of cylinders (cyl)? What is the average horsepower for each group?
	11.	For each cylinder group, calculate both the mean and max horsepower.
	12.	Create a new column power_to_weight = hp / wt. Which car has the highest power-to-weight ratio?
